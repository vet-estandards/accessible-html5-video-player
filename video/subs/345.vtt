00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.785
We often have the need to set out a building

2
00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:06.315
and make sure that when we do set it out that it is square.

3
00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:08.897
Tiles and kitchens and everything like that

4
00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:09.905
based on the principle

5
00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:11.682
that the building is going to be square.

6
00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:14.567
To get it square we will use a method called 3-4-5

7
00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:16.809
and now I am going to give you a demonstration

8
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.920
of how to set up a 3-4-5 triangle.

9
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.601
So what I have done here is first of all put a peg in

10
00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:23.787
at the desired point.

11
00:00:23.787 --> 00:00:25.601
And then I have come along and measured the second point

12
00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:28.468
4 metres along and put a second peg in.

13
00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:34.013
From there I have run a string line

14
00:00:34.013 --> 00:00:36.393
along that 4 metre line.

15
00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.414
Ok, we've got a line here of 4 metres and

16
00:00:53.414 --> 00:00:56.234
now we need to make a line out this way 3 metres

17
00:00:56.234 --> 00:00:58.746
and at the same time we want to make another

18
00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:02.589
line along the hypotenuse from that point

19
00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.219
out 5 metres and join the two together.

20
00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.262
So we got 3 metres.

21
00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:22.961
Ok, so we come along 3 metres

22
00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:25.395
and come off the other point 5 metres.

23
00:01:25.395 --> 00:01:30.801
If we line those up that'll be exactly a right angle triangle.

24
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:34.454
Now I'll extend the string along the 3 metre line.

25
00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:40.739
Tie it off.

26
00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:59.128
Ok, so what we've got is one side that is 4 metres long

27
00:01:59.128 --> 00:02:01.533
we've got the other side that is 3 metres long and another

28
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:04.069
that is 5 metres long.

29
00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.188
If we wanted to check our triangle is square

30
00:02:07.188 --> 00:02:10.341
we can come on over and use a builders square and see

31
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:16.247
it actually is.

32
00:02:16.247 --> 00:02:20.247
So placing it down aligning a side, we can

33
00:02:20.247 --> 00:02:22.047
see that the other side is square as well.
