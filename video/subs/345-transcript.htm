<p>[Matt is standing outdoors in a training building site] We often have the need to set out a building and make sure that when we do set it out that it is square. Tiles and kitchens and everything like that are based on the principle that the building is going to be square. To get it square we use a method called 3-4-5 and now I am going to give you a demonstration of how to set up a 3-4-5 triangle.</p>

<p>So what I have done here is first of all put a peg in at the desired point. [Matt walks to a second peg] ...and then I have come along and measured the second point 4 metres along and put another peg in over here. From there we're going to run a string line along that 4 metre line. [The string is tied to a nail hammered into the top of a wooden peg. He pulls the string to make sure it is tight.]</p>

<p>OK, so we've got a line here of 4 metres and now we need to make a line out this way 3 metres [Matt indicates vaguely behind himself] ...and at the same time we want to make another line along the hypotenuse from that point out 5 metres [points to first peg then behind himself] and join the two together. [He uses a measuring tape to measure 3 metres from the 2nd wooden peg, while another person measures a 5 metre line from the first peg.  They walk towards each other until they meet.]</p>

<p>OK, so we've come along that line 3 metres and come off the other point 5 metres. [Camera focuses on the point where the two measuring tapes meet.] If we line those two points up that'll be exactly a right angle triangle. Now I'll extend the string along the 3 metre line and tie it off down here. [He ties the string to the newly placed 3rd wooden peg. Finally he ties the string from the 3rd peg to the 1st peg creating a triangle.]</p>

<p>OK, so what we've got now is one side that is 4 metres long, we've got the other side that is 3 metres long and the third side is now 5 metres long. If we wanted to check out to see our triangle is square we can come on over and use a builders square and see that it actually is. [He places the builder's sqaure next to the string and wooden peg.] So placing it down running it to one side, we can see that the other side is square as well.</p>
